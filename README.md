# Files_Renamer
FILES REAMER is a VERY USEFUL tool that allows you to change the name and/or extension of multiple files at the same time.

When you run the program, it will ask you for the path where the files are located, write the path, Example: C:\aada11 and always put an inverted slash at the end, the path would look like this: C:\aada11\

Once the path of where all the names to be replaced are entered, the name by which the old name is going to be replaced is written, Example: queonda. Once entered, it will ask you to enter the file extension, Example: .png

Once these data have been entered, all the names of the files will be replaced by the new name that you entered previously and also by the extension entered previously, in case there is an error, you will get an ERROR message.
